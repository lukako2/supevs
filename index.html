          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then, I don't know why, but
          something inside me snapped. I started yelling at the top of my lungs,
          and I insulted him and told him not to waste his prayers on me. I
          grabbed him by the collar of his cassock. I was pouring out on him
          everything that was in my heart, cries of anger and cries of joy. He
          seemed so certain about everything, didn't he? And yet none of his
          certainties was worth one hair of a woman's head. He wasn't even sure
          he was alive, because he was living like a dead man. Whereas it looked
          as if I was the one who'd come up emptyhanded. But I was sure about
          me, about everything, surer than he could ever be, sure of my life and
          sure of the death I had waiting for me. Yes, that was all I had. But
          at least I had as much of a hold on it as it had on me. I had been
          right, I was still right, I was always right. I had lived my life one
          way and I could just as well have lived it another. I had done this
          and I hadn't done that. I hadn't done this thing but I had done
          another. And so? It was as if I had waited all this time for this
          moment and for the first light of this dawn to be vindicated. Nothing,
          nothing mattered, and I knew why. So did he. Throughout the whole
          absurd life I'd lived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from
          somewhere deep in my future, across years that were still to come, and
          as it passed, this wind leveled whatever was offered to me at the
          time, in years no more real than the ones I was living. What did other
          people's deaths or a mother's love matter to me; what did his God or
          the lives people choose or the fate they think they elect matter to me
          when we're all elected by the same fate, me and billions of privileged
          people like him who also called themselves my brothers? Couldn't he
          see, couldn't he see that? Everybody was privileged. There were only
          privileged people. The others would all be condemned one day. And he
          would be condemned, too. What would it matter if he were accused of
          murder and then executed because he didn't cry at his mother's
          funeral? Salamano's dog was worth just as much as his wife. The little
          robot woman was just as guilty as the Parisian woman Masson married,
          or as Marie, who had wanted me to marry her. What did it matter that
          Raymond was as much my friend as Celeste, who was worth a lot more
          than him? What did it matter that Marie now offered her lips to a new
          Meursault? Couldn't he, couldn't this condemned man see ... And that
          from somewhere deep in my future ... All the shouting had me gasping
          for air. But they were already tearing the chaplain from my grip and
          the guards were threatening me. He calmed them, though, and looked at
          me for a moment without saying anything. His eyes were full of tears.
          Then he turned and disappeared.<br /><br />
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With him gone, I was able to
          calm down again. I was exhausted and threw myself on my bunk. I must
          have fallen asleep, because I woke up with the stars in my face.
          Sounds of the countryside were drifting in. Smells of night, earth,
          and salt air were cooling my temples. The wondrous peace of that
          sleeping summer Rowed through me like a tide. Then, in the dark hour
          before dawn, sirens blasted. They were announcing departures for a
          world that now and forever meant nothing to me. For the first time in
          a long time I thought about Maman. I felt as if I understood why at
          the end of her life she had taken a "fiance," why she had played at
          beginning again. Even there, in that home where lives were fading out,
          evening was a kind of wistful respite. So close to death, Maman must
          have felt free then and ready to live it all again. Nobody, nobody had
          the right to cry over her. And I felt ready to live it all again too.
          As if that blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the
          first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself
          to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like
          myself-so like a brother, really-! felt that I had been happy and that
          I was happy again. For everything to be consummated, for me to feel
          less alone, I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of
          spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries
          of hate.
